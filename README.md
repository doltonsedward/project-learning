# project-learning
<p>These are some projects for learning ðŸ“š</p>

<br>

<p>I made this repo for me and those of you who want to learn a programming language based on the project</p>
<br>

<p>Sometimes I feel that my learning is less challenging and just like that every day.</p>
<p>In the end, I tried to create a new way, by learning as well as directly practicing by making projects. And I feel this is good</p>
<br>
<p>Because I remember these words</p>

> Experience is the best teacher

And this

> Theory without practice is bullshit

And this too

> Life must be a process, determine then apply

<br>
<br>

So for those of you who want to immediately create any project after studying. You can try the project I made in this repo.

1. Run my project in your favorite code editor
2. Observe what the target is
3. Try doing it again without peeking at the code
4. Do it again but with a different case for more new experiences

## Notes
Before trying to create a project, try first to learn what is needed to make the project above. 
But whatever it is, back to you it's more comfortable to use what kind of way to study
